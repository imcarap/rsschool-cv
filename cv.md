## Any info about me:
My name is Artem and at the moment, I live in Nizhny Tagil in Sverdlovsk Oblast. I work on Gas station. It's a little bit boring job with low salary. 
So I set a purpose to myself to change my location and job. At the beginning, I chosed Python to selfeducation. But about month ago I decided to change it to Frontend. I think that learning JS, creating websites on html and user interfaces using React libs is interesting. Becides, I want to practice my English. I know that it will be a hard way, but I like it. 
## My skills:
I studied Basic Python 3, HTML5, Basic CSS3 and Figma. 
## Code sample:
``` 
function perimeterSequence(a,n) {
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0 ; i < n; i++) {
    sum += 4 * a;
  }
  return sum;
}
```
## My education:
I have secondary vocational education. I am metallurgist. 
## Languages:
English, A2-B1 lvl.
